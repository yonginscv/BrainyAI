## For developers


### Getting started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install pnpm -g
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

### Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

### Making production(debug) build, which will reserve the logs

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build:staing
```
